# Proof of Concept Scope

The User Interface for most of our concepts have been implemented to display roughly how the website will look once it is completed for the Finished Product. We have 3 main views: Main page, Search for Vaccines page, and Account page. The Main Page is where we will eventually add some information about vaccines to help educate users about the usefulness of Vaccines. On the Search for Vaccines page, we present the user with a search bar as well as a map to show locations that offer vaccinations. These locations will eventually have data such as wait times, ratings, and types of vaccines offered when clicking on the location. In the Account page, users will be able to log in/sign up and log in personal vaccination data such as which vaccines they have taken, the date of these vaccinations, and the location of these vaccinations. I would like to mention that we recently lost a team member and are now only a team of 3, but we have already discussed how we plan to continue in achieving our milestones for the MVP.
